A very simple pair of scripts for automating backups of a cPanel site.

cpanel_backup.sh performs a full backup, including of all user databases, but
mysql_backup.sh is provided so that smaller, more frequent backups may be taken
of the database/s alone.

These should be invoked by a cron job.  The resulting archives need to be
copied off site, but these scripts do not provide a mechanism for that at
present.

It is assumed that cURL, GnuPG, mysqldump, gzip and bzip2 are available in the
environment.
